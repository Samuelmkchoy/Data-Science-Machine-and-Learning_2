•	I start this project through extensive research, using our course materials and external web resources. Here is the list of resources for my project:

•	I explored and selected new datasets that fit the goals of the project. I then made significant adjustments and implemented various algorithms, customizing them to fit the unique characteristics of these datasets. To improve the performance of the algorithm, I have carefully tuned the parameters and hyperparameters.

•	I am currently working on creating a serialized deployment version of the Bayesian Classifier model. However, I am facing some issues with it. Meanwhile, I am working on other notebooks.
